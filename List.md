#Aikido

> Aikido (合気道, aikidō, Japanese pronunciation: [aikiꜜdoː], kyūjitai: 合氣道) is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury.[1][2] Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy"[3] or as "the way of harmonious spirit".[4] According to the founder's philosophy, the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness.[5] Morihei Ueshiba used the phrase "masakatsu agatsu katsuhayabi" (Japanese: 正勝吾勝勝速日) ("true victory, final victory over oneself, here and now") to refer to this principle[6].

# Titles

O-Sensei -

> Ōsensei (大先生/翁先生, great teacher, grand master) is a Japanese term, a stronger form of sensei (先生, teacher).

Doshu  
Waka-Sensei  
Dojo-cho  
Shihan -

> Shihan (師範) - Title of "Master" is a Japanese Honorific Title, Expert License Certification used in Japanese martial arts for Master Level Instructors. The award of the Expert License Certification is if designated by the qualification by virtue of endorsement by the [A] Association of Chief Instructors or [B] Administration Head of an Association. SHOU-GOU 称号 is the masters title-system set up by the Dai-Nippon Butoku-kai (greater Japan Budo Encouragement Federation established in 1895 in Kyoto). It is consist of three ranks, Renshi, Kyoshi and Hanshi. The sho-go awarded consist of the three similar ranks and are therefore classical ranks/titles similar to Samurai titles given under the auspices of Japan's Imperial Family during feudal times. The award of sho-go is based on each individual’s knowledge, teaching ability and the outstanding development of character through the study of the karate. Therefore it is important to realize that in the modern approach to karate, these titles/ranks are much more difficult to achieve than the conventional Dan grades and are NOT automatically assigned with rank or seniority. The holder of these titles must also have made significant contributions to the karate community at large. The title/sho-go may or may not be given to a Fellow on application, or may be awarded after the fellow has been in fellowship for some time.
